# SABD Discord Bot

...or is it?

## What will this bot do?

- Update users on the price of cryptocurrencies on demand
- Create a wallet for each user on the server for a specific coin
- Be able to send people coins through the discord channel
- Share news about cryptocurrency to a relevant channel
- Have a place where it can be configured by the server administrators
- Update discord on the development of this bot
- And more...

I would recommend running this on Linux and not on Windows because Windows will make you install Visual Studio just to get the build tools to make this work. Yuck.

~Additionally, Windows will make you install the world's most comprehensive IDE, so there's that. If you're a VS fan, then run this B on Windows and good luck to you. I am running it on Windows right now.~

UPDATE: you really only need msys/mingw installed to make this work. Oops. 

Thanks for reading, though. This will get changed a lot as the development continues.
