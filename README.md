...or is it?

I would recommend running this on Linux and not on Windows because Windows will make you install Visual Studio just to get the build tools to make this work. Yuck.

Additionally, Windows will make you install the world's most comprehensive IDE, so there's that. If you're a VS fan, then run this B on Windows and good luck to you. I am running it on Windows right now.

Thanks for reading, though. This will get changed a lot as the development continues.
